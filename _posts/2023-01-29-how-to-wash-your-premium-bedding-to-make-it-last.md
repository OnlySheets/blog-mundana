You've invested in luxury sheets. Now, how do you keep them feeling brand new for years?

## The Golden Rules
1.  **Cool Water**: Hot water breaks down fibers. Stick to cool or warm.
2.  **Gentle Cycle**: Don't beat up your sheets.
3.  **Skip the Softener**: Fabric softeners coat the fibers, reducing absorbency and breathability. Good cotton softens naturally!
4.  **Line Dry (if possible)**: Sunlight is a natural disinfectant and whitener. If using a dryer, use low heat.

## The OnlySheets Promise
Our sheets are designed to get better with age. Follow these simple steps, and your 3000rs investment will pay dividends in comfort for years to come.
