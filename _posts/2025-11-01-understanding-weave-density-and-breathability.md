We talk a lot about "breathability" in bedding. But what does it actually mean? And why does one sheet make you sweat while another keeps you cool?

It is not magic. It is physics.

Specifically, it is about **Weave Density** and **Air Permeability**.

When you buy sheets, you are essentially buying a grid of threads. The spacing between those threads determines how much air can pass through the fabric to reach your skin.

## The Goldilocks Principle

Imagine a screen door.
*   **Too Open**: If the holes are too big, bugs get in.
*   **Too Closed**: If the holes are too small, no air gets in.

Bed sheets work the same way.

### 1. Low Density (Under 200 Thread Count)
Cheap sheets have a very loose weave.
*   **Pros**: Very breathable.
*   **Cons**: The threads are so far apart that the fabric feels rough, flimsy, and weak. It pills easily and tears quickly. It feels like cheesecloth.

### 2. High Density (Over 800 Thread Count)
This is the "1000 Thread Count" trap we discussed earlier. To jam that many threads into an inch, the weave has to be incredibly tight.
*   **Pros**: Feels dense and heavy (if you like that).
*   **Cons**: There are almost no gaps for air to pass through. The fabric acts like a barrier, trapping your body heat and moisture underneath. It is like sleeping under a tarp.

### 3. The Sweet Spot (300 - 500 Thread Count)
This is where OnlySheets lives.
In this range, the threads are packed tightly enough to create a smooth, durable surface, but loosely enough to allow for "micro-gaps."
*   **The Result**: Heat from your body can escape through these micro-gaps, and cool air from the room can flow in. This convective cooling is what keeps you comfortable all night.

## Percale vs. Sateen: A Density Comparison

Even within the sweet spot, the *type* of weave matters.

*   **Percale (1-over-1)**: This is the most breathable structure. The simple grid pattern leaves the most open space between threads. It has high air permeability. Perfect for hot sleepers.
*   **Sateen (4-over-1)**: This weave floats more threads on the surface. This creates a denser face of fabric. While still breathable (if made from cotton), it is *less* breathable than Percale. It retains more warmth. Perfect for cold sleepers.

## Why Material Matters

Crucially, this only applies to natural fibers like **Cotton**.
Synthetic fibers like microfiber (polyester) are plastic. Even if the weave is loose, the fiber itself does not absorb moisture. It just sits on your skin.

Cotton fibers are hollow and absorbent. They pull moisture (sweat) off your skin and move it to the surface of the fabric, where the airflow (from the weave) evaporates it.

## Conclusion

Don't get blinded by high numbers. A higher thread count often means *lower* breathability.

If you want the perfect night's sleep, you need balance. You need a sheet that is strong enough to last, smooth enough to caress, and open enough to breathe.

That is the science behind OnlySheets. We don't just weave threads; we engineer comfort.
