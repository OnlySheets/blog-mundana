Did you know your pillowcase could be causing your breakouts?

## The Friction Factor
Rough fabrics cause friction, irritating skin and spreading bacteria.
## The Absorption Factor
Cotton is absorbent. If you don't wash it often, it holds onto oils and sweat.

## The Solution
1.  **Silky Smooth Weave**: Sateen reduces friction.
2.  **Breathability**: Reduces sweating.
3.  **Change Often**: We recommend changing pillowcases every 2-3 days.

**Upgrade your beauty routine.** Start with the foundation: your pillowcase.
