It's the nemesis of laundry day. The fitted sheet ball.

## The Method
1.  Hold the sheet by two adjacent corners, inside out.
2.  Tuck one corner inside the other.
3.  Pick up the third corner and tuck it in.
4.  Pick up the fourth and tuck it in.
5.  Lay it on a table; you should have a rectangle now.
6.  Fold into a neat square.

**Too much work?** Just roll it! Or better yet, put it straight back on the bed. Our sheets look great no matter how you fold them.
