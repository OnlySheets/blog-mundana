It is the universal nemesis of laundry day. You wash your sheets, you dry them, and you neatly fold the flat sheet and the pillowcases. And then, you are left with *it*. The fitted sheet.

The shapeless, elasticated blob that defies geometry.

For most of us, "folding" a fitted sheet involves a complex maneuver of rolling, scrunching, and eventually shoving it into the back of the linen closet, hoping no one ever opens the door. But it doesn't have to be this way. A neatly folded fitted sheet not only looks better but also takes up less space and has fewer wrinkles when you put it on the bed.

In this guide, we are going to demystify the process. We will turn that ball of frustration into a neat, crisp rectangle.

## The "Corner-Tuck" Method

The secret to folding a fitted sheet is to realize that it *is* a rectangle; it just has elastic corners that want to curl up. Your goal is to tuck the corners into each other to create a flat edge.

### Step 1: The Setup
Stand up and hold the fitted sheet lengthwise (so the long side is horizontal). Place your hands inside two adjacent corners. The sheet should be inside out.

### Step 2: The First Tuck
Bring your right hand over to your left hand. Fold the corner in your right hand *over* the corner in your left hand. You should now have two corners tucked into one, resting on your left hand.
*   *Check*: Ensure the seams are aligned so the corner looks neat.

### Step 3: The Second Tuck
Reach down and pick up the third corner (the one hanging below your left hand) and tuck it into the two you are already holding. Then, do the same with the fourth corner.
*   *Goal*: You should now have all four corners tucked into each other, all resting on one hand.

### Step 4: The Lay Down
Lay the sheet on a flat surface (a bed or table). Because all the elastic corners are tucked into one spot, the sheet should now form a rough L-shape or rectangle.
Smooth it out with your hands. This is the most important part—flatten the edges so they are straight.

### Step 5: The Fold
Now that it is lying flat:
1.  Fold the sheet in half (or thirds, depending on the size) lengthwise to create a long strip.
2.  Fold that strip into a square or rectangle that matches the size of your folded flat sheet.

## Why Bother?

You might be asking, "Why should I care? It's just going in a closet."

1.  **Space Saving**: A properly folded sheet takes up about half the space of a rolled-up ball.
2.  **Wrinkle Reduction**: Crushing your sheet into a ball sets deep wrinkles that won't smooth out on the bed. Folding it keeps it crisp.
3.  **Mental Peace**: There is a profound sense of satisfaction in opening a linen closet and seeing neat, organized stacks. It is a small victory of order over chaos.

## The "I Give Up" Alternative

Look, we get it. Sometimes life is too short to fold fitted sheets. If you can't master the fold, here is our favorite hack:

**The Pillowcase Trick**: Fold your flat sheet and one pillowcase neatly. Roll up your fitted sheet (as neatly as possible). Place the entire set inside the second pillowcase.
*   **The Result**: You have a neat little package that contains your whole bedding set. No one can see the messy fitted sheet inside, and your closet looks organized.

At OnlySheets, we design our bedding to bring you comfort, not stress. Whether you fold it like a pro or stuff it in a pillowcase, the most important thing is how it feels when you sleep on it.
