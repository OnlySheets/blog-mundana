It's simple physics. Air needs space to move.

*   **Low Thread Count (under 200)**: Too much space, feels rough and flimsy.
*   **High Thread Count (over 800)**: Too little space, traps heat and moisture.
*   **The Sweet Spot (300-500)**: The perfect balance. Tight enough to be smooth and durable, open enough to let your skin breathe.

**Don't suffocate your skin.** Choose the scientifically balanced comfort of OnlySheets.
