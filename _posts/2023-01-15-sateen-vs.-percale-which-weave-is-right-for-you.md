Choosing the right weave is as important as choosing the right material. The two most popular weaves are Sateen and Percale.

## Percale: The Crisp Choice
*   **Feel**: Cool, crisp, matte finish. Like a classic button-down shirt.
*   **Best for**: Hot sleepers, summer months.
*   **Durability**: Very durable due to the one-over-one-under weave.

## Sateen: The Silky Choice
*   **Feel**: Silky, smooth, slight sheen. Heavier and warmer.
*   **Best for**: Cold sleepers, winter months, or those who love a draped feel.
*   **Look**: Elegant and luminous.

## Which one should you buy?
If you wake up sweating, go for **Percale**. If you love snuggling into something soft and warm, **Sateen** is your best friend.

**Find your perfect match.** We stock both premium Percale and Sateen sheets crafted for the ultimate sleep experience.
