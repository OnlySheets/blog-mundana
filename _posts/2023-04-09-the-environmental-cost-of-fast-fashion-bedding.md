Cheap sheets are disposable. They wear out quickly and end up in landfills. Synthetic sheets (microfiber) shed microplastics into our oceans with every wash.

## The Sustainable Choice
High-quality cotton is biodegradable and durable. Buying one set of great sheets that lasts 5 years is better for the planet than buying 5 cheap sets.

**Sleep with a clear conscience.** Choose OnlySheets for durability and sustainability.
