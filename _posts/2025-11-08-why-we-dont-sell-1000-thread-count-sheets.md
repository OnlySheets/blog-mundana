In the world of bedding, there is a magic number that everyone looks for: 1000.

For decades, marketing campaigns have drilled into our heads that "higher thread count equals better quality." We see "1000 Thread Count Egyptian Cotton" on packaging and assume it must be the pinnacle of luxury.

So, why doesn't OnlySheets sell them?

It's not because we can't make them. It's because **1000 thread count sheets are usually a lie.**

At OnlySheets, we value transparency over marketing gimmicks. Here is the truth about thread count that most brands won't tell you.

## The Math Doesn't Add Up

Thread count is defined as the number of vertical and horizontal threads in one square inch of fabric.

Physically, you can only fit so many threads into an inch before they run out of space. With high-quality, single-ply cotton yarn, the maximum number of threads you can squeeze into a square inch is usually around 400 to 600.

So, how do brands get to 1000?

## The "Multi-Ply" Trick

To inflate the numbers, manufacturers use a deceptive technique called "multi-ply yarn."

Instead of using one strong, high-quality thread, they twist 3 or 4 thin, weak, cheap threads together to create a single strand.
*   **Honest Math**: 1 strand = 1 thread.
*   **Marketing Math**: They count each of those tiny twisted strands as a separate thread.

So, if they use a 3-ply yarn and weave 300 of them into an inch, they multiply 300 x 3 and label it "900 Thread Count."

## Why High Thread Count Can Be Bad

You might think, "Well, isn't more thread still better?" Not necessarily.

Using multi-ply yarns to achieve these astronomical numbers often results in a fabric that is:
1.  **Heavy and Thick**: The sheet feels like a heavy blanket or canvas rather than a light, airy sheet.
2.  **Not Breathable**: The weave is so dense that air cannot pass through. This creates a "suffocation" effect, trapping body heat and causing you to sweat.
3.  **Prone to Pilling**: Those cheap, thin threads that were twisted together often break and unravel, leading to rough, pill-covered sheets after a few washes.

## The Sweet Spot: 300 to 500

True luxury comes from the **quality** of the thread, not the quantity.

A 300 or 400 thread count sheet made from **Long-Staple Cotton** (like we use at OnlySheets) is superior to a 1000 thread count sheet made from short-staple, multi-ply cotton.

*   **Softness**: Our single-ply yarn is smoother and softer against the skin.
*   **Breathability**: The balanced weave allows for optimal airflow, keeping you cool.
*   **Durability**: One strong thread is better than three weak ones twisted together.

## Our Promise

We refuse to play the numbers game. We don't sell 1000 thread count sheets because we don't believe they offer the best sleep experience.

We sell honest, authentic, high-quality cotton in the "sweet spot" of 300-500 thread count. It is the perfect balance of lightness, strength, and softness.

Don't be fooled by the number on the package. Feel the fabric. Look for "Single-Ply" and "Long-Staple." That is where the real luxury lies.
