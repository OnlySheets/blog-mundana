There is a specific feeling you get when you walk into a high-end hotel room. You drop your bags, look at the bed, and instantly feel your stress melt away. The sheets are crisp and white, the pillows are fluffy, and the whole room screams "relax."

Why do we sleep so well in hotels? Is it the mattress? The blackout curtains?

While those help, the secret lies mostly in the **bedding**. Hotels have mastered the art of sleep psychology. The good news is, you don't need a room key to get that feeling. You can recreate it in your own bedroom with a few simple upgrades.

Here is the 5-step formula to turning your bedroom into a 5-star suite.

## 1. The White Sheet Rule

Have you noticed that almost every luxury hotel uses white sheets? This isn't a coincidence.
*   **The Halo Effect**: White sheets create a "halo" effect around the bed, making it the focal point of the room.
*   **Cleanliness**: White signals pristine cleanliness. It tells your brain, "This bed is fresh and new," which helps you relax.
*   **The Look**: White matches everything and never goes out of style. It looks crisp, airy, and expensive.

**Action Step**: Ditch the busy patterns. Invest in a high-quality set of **White Percale or Sateen sheets** from OnlySheets.

## 2. The "Hospital Corners" Tuck

Hotels make the bed look tight and tidy. A messy bed feels chaotic; a tight bed feels organized.
Learn to do "hospital corners" on your flat sheet. It involves a specific fold at the corners of the mattress that locks the sheet in place, creating that taut, military-grade smoothness that feels so good to slide into.

## 3. Layering is Key

Hotels don't just throw a duvet on the bed. They layer.
*   **The Sandwich**: Fitted sheet -> Flat Sheet -> Duvet -> Throw Blanket.
*   **Why**: This adds visual weight and texture to the bed, making it look inviting and plush. It also gives you temperature options during the night.

## 4. Pillow Overload

A standard hotel bed has at least four pillows for two people. Two for sleeping, and two for propping yourself up while reading or watching TV.
*   **The Look**: Stand the pillows up against the headboard rather than laying them flat. This gives the bed height and grandeur.

## 5. Lighting and Scent

Finally, set the mood. Hotels use warm, soft lighting (2700K color temperature) to signal to your body that it is time to wind down.
They also often have a subtle scent—white tea, lavender, or eucalyptus.
*   **Action Step**: Get a warm-toned bedside lamp and a linen spray. A quick spritz of lavender on your pillow before bed can trigger a sleep response in your brain.

## Conclusion

You spend one-third of your life in your bedroom. Why should it feel like an afterthought? By investing in white linens, learning to make your bed properly, and adding a few layers of comfort, you can wake up every morning feeling like you are on vacation.
