Toasters break. Blenders get stored away. But a set of luxury sheets? That's a gift used every single night.

## Why It Works
*   **Practical Luxury**: Something they need, but better than they'd buy themselves.
*   **Longevity**: A reminder of your gift for years.
*   **Universal Appeal**: Everyone sleeps!

Give the gift of better sleep. It's the ultimate way to say 'I care about your well-being.'
