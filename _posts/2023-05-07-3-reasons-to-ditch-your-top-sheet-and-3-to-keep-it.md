The great debate: Top sheet or no top sheet?

## Team No Top Sheet (The European Way)
1.  Less tangling.
2.  Easier to make the bed.
3.  Closer contact with the duvet.

## Team Top Sheet (The American Way)
1.  Hygiene: Keeps the duvet cover clean longer.
2.  Temperature Control: Perfect for when it's too hot for a duvet but too cold for nothing.
3.  Layered look.

**Whatever your style, we've got you covered.** Our sets come with or without top sheets to suit your preference.
