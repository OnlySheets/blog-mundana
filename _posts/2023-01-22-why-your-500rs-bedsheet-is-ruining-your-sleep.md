We spend a third of our lives in bed. Yet, many of us skimp on the one thing that touches our skin all night: our sheets.

## The Problem with Cheap Sheets
*   **Rough Texture**: Micro-abrasions can irritate sensitive skin.
*   **Poor Breathability**: Synthetic blends trap heat, leading to night sweats and disrupted sleep.
*   **Chemicals**: Cheap dyes and finishes can cause allergies.

## The Premium Difference
A 3000rs bedsheet isn't just a luxury; it's an investment in your health. Natural fibers breathe, regulating your body temperature. The smooth surface prevents sleep lines and hair breakage.

**Stop compromising on your sleep.** You deserve better. Upgrade to OnlySheets and wake up refreshed.
