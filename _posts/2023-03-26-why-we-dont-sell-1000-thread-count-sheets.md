You won't find 1000 thread count sheets at OnlySheets. Here's why.

To fit 1000 threads in an inch, you have to use extremely thin, weak threads twisted together. This creates a dense, heavy fabric that doesn't breathe and is prone to tearing.

We believe in **honest luxury**. Our 400 thread count sheets use single-ply, long-staple cotton. It's the perfect balance of softness, strength, and breathability.

**Experience the honest truth.** Try our perfectly balanced sheets today.
