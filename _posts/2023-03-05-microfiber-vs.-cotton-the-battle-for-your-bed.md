Microfiber sheets are everywhere. They are cheap, soft, and colorful. But are they good?

## What is Microfiber?
It's plastic. Polyester strands thinner than a human hair.
*   **Pros**: Cheap, wrinkle-resistant.
*   **Cons**: Traps heat, generates static, traps dust and allergens, bad for the environment (microplastics).

## Cotton: The Natural Choice
*   **Pros**: Breathable, durable, hypoallergenic, biodegradable.
*   **Cons**: Costs more upfront.

**Your skin knows the difference.** Don't wrap yourself in plastic. Choose the natural breathability of OnlySheets cotton.
