You've heard of Egyptian Cotton, but do you know why it's considered the gold standard for bedding?

## The Secret is in the Fiber
Egyptian cotton is hand-picked, which puts less stress on the fibers, leaving them straight and intact. These fibers can be made into longer, finer yarns. This means:
*   **Softer feel**: No rough ends to poke you.
*   **Stronger fabric**: Resists pilling and tearing.
*   **Better color**: Absorbs dye better for vibrant, long-lasting color.

## The Investment
Yes, Egyptian cotton costs more than regular cotton. But consider this: a cheap 500rs sheet might last a year before it pills and feels rough. A premium 3000rs Egyptian cotton sheet gets softer with every wash and can last for years.
