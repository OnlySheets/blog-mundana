You see the term 'long-staple' on our packaging. What does it mean?

Cotton fibers come in different lengths.
*   **Short-staple**: Common, rougher, ends stick out (fuzz).
*   **Long-staple**: Rare, smoother, stronger.

Think of it like hair. Long strands can be braided smoothly. Short strands have flyaways. Long-staple cotton makes for smoother, stronger yarn.

**Feel the difference.** Our sheets are made exclusively from long-staple cotton.
