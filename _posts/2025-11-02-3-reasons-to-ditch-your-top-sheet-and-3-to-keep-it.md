It is the most controversial topic in the bedding world. It divides households, marriages, and nations.

**The Top Sheet.**

Do you use one? Or do you sleep directly under the duvet cover?

In the US, the top sheet (or flat sheet) is standard. In Europe, it is almost non-existent. In India, we are somewhere in between.

At OnlySheets, we sell sets with top sheets, but we know many of you leave them folded in the closet. So, let's settle this once and for all. Here are the arguments for both sides.

## Team No Top Sheet (The European Way)

If you hate the top sheet, you are likely a practical minimalist.

### 1. No More Tangling
We have all been there. You wake up in the middle of the night with the top sheet twisted around your ankles like a boa constrictor, while the duvet is on the floor. Without a top sheet, there is nothing to get tangled in. You just have one fluffy layer.

### 2. Bed Making is a Breeze
Making the bed with a top sheet involves tucking, smoothing, and aligning. Without it? You just shake out the duvet and throw it on the bed. Done in 10 seconds.

### 3. Better Temperature Regulation (For Some)
Some people find that the top sheet traps too much heat or feels restrictive. Sleeping directly under a breathable cotton duvet cover feels freer and airier.

## Team Top Sheet (The Traditional Way)

If you love the top sheet, you likely value hygiene and versatility.

### 1. Hygiene (The Lazy Wash)
This is the biggest argument. The top sheet acts as a barrier between your body and the heavy duvet / comforter.
*   **The Logic**: It is much easier to wash a thin sheet every week than it is to wrestle a duvet cover off and on. If you use a top sheet, you can wash your duvet cover once a month instead of every week.

### 2. The "Thermostat" Layer
The top sheet is perfect for temperature control.
*   **Hot Night**: Kick off the duvet and sleep under just the sheet.
*   **Cold Night**: Pull up both layers.
*   Without a top sheet, it is all or nothing.

### 3. The Sensory Experience
There is something undeniably luxurious about the weight and crispness of a tucked-in top sheet. It makes the bed feel secure and "finished." It provides that hotel-like feeling of being tucked in.

## The Verdict?

There is no right answer. It comes down to your personal sleep style.

*   **Are you a restless sleeper?** Ditch it.
*   **Do you hate doing laundry?** Keep it.
*   **Do you get hot easily?** Keep it (as your only layer).

At OnlySheets, we believe in giving you the choice. That is why our sheet sets come with a generous, long-staple cotton flat sheet. Whether you use it to cover yourself, cover your mattress, or build a fort, the quality remains the same.

**Which team are you on?** Try it both ways with an OnlySheets set and decide for yourself.
