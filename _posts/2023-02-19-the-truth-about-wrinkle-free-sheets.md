Who likes ironing? No one. But 'wrinkle-free' sheets come at a hidden cost.

## The Chemical Bath
To make cotton resist wrinkles, it's often treated with formaldehyde resin. Yes, the same stuff used in biology labs. This chemical bond prevents the fibers from relaxing, but it also:
*   Reduces breathability.
*   Can cause skin irritation.
*   Washes out over time, leaving you with wrinkles anyway.

## Embrace the Crinkle
High-quality, untreated cotton will wrinkle. It's a sign of purity. We recommend taking them out of the dryer slightly damp and smoothing them by hand on the bed.

**Choose health over convenience.** Our sheets are 100% chemical-free for a safe, natural sleep.
