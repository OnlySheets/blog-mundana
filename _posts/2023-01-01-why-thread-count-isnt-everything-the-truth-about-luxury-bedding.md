Most people think higher thread count means better quality. But is a 1000 thread count sheet really better than a 400 one? Not necessarily.

## The Thread Count Myth
Thread count refers to the number of threads woven into a square inch of fabric. Marketing has convinced us that higher is always better. However, manufacturers often use multi-ply threads to artificially inflate this number, resulting in heavier, less breathable sheets.

## What Actually Matters
1. **Fiber Quality**: Long-staple cotton (like Egyptian or Pima) is softer and more durable.
2. **Weave**: Percale for crisp coolness, Sateen for silky smoothness.
3. **Finish**: How the fabric is treated after weaving.

At OnlySheets, we focus on the sweet spot: 300-500 thread count single-ply long-staple cotton. This ensures breathability, durability, and that hotel-like crispness.

**Upgrade your sleep today.** Don't settle for marketing gimmicks. Experience the difference of true quality with our premium collection.
