Nothing lasts forever, not even your favorite sheets. Here are 5 signs you need an upgrade:

1.  **Visible Wear**: Thinning fabric or small holes.
2.  **Yellowing**: Stains that won't wash out.
3.  **Pilling**: Little balls of fabric that feel like sandpaper.
4.  **Elastic Failure**: Fitted sheets that won't stay put.
5.  **Itchiness**: If you're not sighing with relief when you get into bed, something is wrong.

**Don't suffer through another night.** If you nodded to any of these, it's time for an OnlySheets upgrade.
