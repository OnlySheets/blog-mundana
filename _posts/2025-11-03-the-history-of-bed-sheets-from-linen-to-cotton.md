Today, we take soft, colorful, fitted sheets for granted. We click a button, and they arrive at our door. But for most of human history, a comfortable bed was a luxury reserved for the ultra-rich.

The history of bedding is a fascinating journey through technology, agriculture, and social status. Let's travel back in time to see how we got from sleeping on piles of leaves to sleeping on 500-thread-count cotton.

## Ancient Egypt: The Linen Era

The story begins in Ancient Egypt, around 3000 BC.
The Egyptians were masters of weaving flax into **Linen**.
*   **The Status Symbol**: Bed sheets were a sign of extreme wealth. Only pharaohs and high nobility slept on linen sheets. The common people slept on palm fronds or wool mats.
*   **The Mummy Connection**: The same linen used for bedding was used to wrap mummies for the afterlife. They believed that comfort in the eternal sleep was just as important as sleep in the living world.

## Medieval Europe: The Cold Reality

Fast forward to Medieval Europe. Beds were massive, communal affairs. Entire families (and sometimes guests) would sleep in one large bed to conserve heat.
*   **The Setup**: The mattress was usually a sack stuffed with straw or feathers.
*   **The Sheets**: Linen was still the fabric of choice because it became softer with use and was easy to wash. However, it was white and plain. Color dyes were too expensive to waste on something you slept on.

## The Cotton Revolution

Cotton was known in India for thousands of years, but it didn't become the global standard for bedding until the 18th and 19th centuries.
*   **The Industrial Revolution**: With the invention of the cotton gin and mechanical looms, cotton fabric became cheaper and faster to produce than linen.
*   **The Shift**: Suddenly, soft, washable bed sheets were accessible to the middle class, not just the aristocracy. Cotton was warmer than linen, softer than wool, and easier to dye.

## The Invention of the Fitted Sheet

Believe it or not, the **fitted sheet** is a very recent invention.
Until the 1950s, everyone used flat sheets. You had to expertly fold and tuck the bottom sheet to keep it on the mattress.
*   **Bertha Berman**: In 1959, a woman named Bertha Berman patented a design for a fitted sheet with elastic corners. It revolutionized bed-making, saving millions of people from the frustration of untucked sheets.

## Modern Day: The Paradox of Choice

Today, we are overwhelmed with choices: Percale, Sateen, Bamboo, Tencel, Microfiber.
But despite all the technological advancements, the gold standard remains surprisingly traditional: **1000% Long-Staple Cotton.**

It turns out the ancients were onto something. Natural fibers that breathe and soften with age are still the best surface for the human body to rest on.

At OnlySheets, we honor this history by sticking to the classics. We don't do synthetic blends or high-tech gimmicks. We just weave the finest cotton into the finest sheets, continuing a tradition of comfort that started 5,000 years ago.
