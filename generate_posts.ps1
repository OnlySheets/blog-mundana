Most people think higher thread count means better quality. But is a 1000 thread count sheet really better than a 400 one? Not necessarily.

## The Thread Count Myth
Thread count refers to the number of threads woven into a square inch of fabric. Marketing has convinced us that higher is always better. However, manufacturers often use multi-ply threads to artificially inflate this number, resulting in heavier, less breathable sheets.

## What Actually Matters
1. **Fiber Quality**: Long-staple cotton (like Egyptian or Pima) is softer and more durable.
2. **Weave**: Percale for crisp coolness, Sateen for silky smoothness.
3. **Finish**: How the fabric is treated after weaving.

At OnlySheets, we focus on the sweet spot: 300-500 thread count single-ply long-staple cotton. This ensures breathability, durability, and that hotel-like crispness.

**Upgrade your sleep today.** Don't settle for marketing gimmicks. Experience the difference of true quality with our premium collection.

You've heard of Egyptian Cotton, but do you know why it's considered the gold standard for bedding?

## The Secret is in the Fiber
Egyptian cotton is hand-picked, which puts less stress on the fibers, leaving them straight and intact. These fibers can be made into longer, finer yarns. This means:
*   **Softer feel**: No rough ends to poke you.
*   **Stronger fabric**: Resists pilling and tearing.
*   **Better color**: Absorbs dye better for vibrant, long-lasting color.

## The Investment
Yes, Egyptian cotton costs more than regular cotton. But consider this: a cheap 500rs sheet might last a year before it pills and feels rough. A premium 3000rs Egyptian cotton sheet gets softer with every wash and can last for years.

**Invest in your rest.** Browse our authentic Egyptian Cotton range and feel the difference tonight.

        content = @"
Choosing the right weave is as important as choosing the right material. The two most popular weaves are Sateen and Percale.

## Percale: The Crisp Choice
*   **Feel**: Cool, crisp, matte finish. Like a classic button-down shirt.
*   **Best for**: Hot sleepers, summer months.
*   **Durability**: Very durable due to the one-over-one-under weave.

## Sateen: The Silky Choice
*   **Feel**: Silky, smooth, slight sheen. Heavier and warmer.
*   **Best for**: Cold sleepers, winter months, or those who love a draped feel.
*   **Look**: Elegant and luminous.

## Which one should you buy?
If you wake up sweating, go for **Percale**. If you love snuggling into something soft and warm, **Sateen** is your best friend.

**Find your perfect match.** We stock both premium Percale and Sateen sheets crafted for the ultimate sleep experience.

We spend a third of our lives in bed. Yet, many of us skimp on the one thing that touches our skin all night: our sheets.

## The Problem with Cheap Sheets
*   **Rough Texture**: Micro-abrasions can irritate sensitive skin.
*   **Poor Breathability**: Synthetic blends trap heat, leading to night sweats and disrupted sleep.
*   **Chemicals**: Cheap dyes and finishes can cause allergies.

## The Premium Difference
A 3000rs bedsheet isn't just a luxury; it's an investment in your health. Natural fibers breathe, regulating your body temperature. The smooth surface prevents sleep lines and hair breakage.

**Stop compromising on your sleep.** You deserve better. Upgrade to OnlySheets and wake up refreshed.

You've invested in luxury sheets. Now, how do you keep them feeling brand new for years?

## The Golden Rules
1.  **Cool Water**: Hot water breaks down fibers. Stick to cool or warm.
2.  **Gentle Cycle**: Don't beat up your sheets.
3.  **Skip the Softener**: Fabric softeners coat the fibers, reducing absorbency and breathability. Good cotton softens naturally!
4.  **Line Dry (if possible)**: Sunlight is a natural disinfectant and whitener. If using a dryer, use low heat.

## The OnlySheets Promise
Our sheets are designed to get better with age. Follow these simple steps, and your 3000rs investment will pay dividends in comfort for years to come.

Who likes ironing? No one. But 'wrinkle-free' sheets come at a hidden cost.

## The Chemical Bath
To make cotton resist wrinkles, it's often treated with formaldehyde resin. Yes, the same stuff used in biology labs. This chemical bond prevents the fibers from relaxing, but it also:
*   Reduces breathability.
*   Can cause skin irritation.
*   Washes out over time, leaving you with wrinkles anyway.

## Embrace the Crinkle
High-quality, untreated cotton will wrinkle. It's a sign of purity. We recommend taking them out of the dryer slightly damp and smoothing them by hand on the bed.

**Choose health over convenience.** Our sheets are 100% chemical-free for a safe, natural sleep.

## Cotton: The Natural Choice

4.  Pick up the fourth and tuck it in.

Did you know your pillowcase could be causing your breakouts?

Rough fabrics cause friction, irritating skin and spreading bacteria.

Cotton is absorbent. If you don't wash it often, it holds onto oils and sweat.

1.  **Silky Smooth Weave**: Sateen reduces friction.
2.  **Breathability**: Reduces sweating.
3.  **Change Often**: We recommend changing pillowcases every 2-3 days.

You see the term 'long-staple' on our packaging. What does it mean?

Cotton fibers come in different lengths.

Think of it like hair. Long strands can be braided smoothly. Short strands have flyaways. Long-staple cotton makes for smoother, stronger yarn.
